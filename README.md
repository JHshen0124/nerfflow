# NeRF-Flow: A High Performance Neural Rendering Framework

## Motivation
Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have emerged as a transformative advance in photorealistic view synthesis and novel view generation. It can be seen as the next generation of graphic render technique after ray-tracing and rasterization.

While recent methods have made progress, major challenges remain in neural rendering. Current NeRF implementations offer high visual quality but lack performance for fast rendering. Hardware accelerators can help, but have limited portability across platforms and lack adaptability across scenes. Algorithmic optimizations also accelerate NeRF queries, but reduce programmability and are not easily portable.

We see opportunities in a full stack end-to-end neural rendering framework that can match algorithmic and hardware gaps.

## Project Vision

We aims to make photo realistic rendering portable to all device and scalable to a wide range of environment. For example, VR devices and edge devices.

## Platforms

NeRF-Accelerator, GPU, TPU, CPU
